# Various-Python-Scripts-and-Notes
This repo contains a few of the many python scripts and notes I've used to learn python. 

Many of these example scripts are from Python Books and Videos tutorials I've worked through including the book Automate the Boring Stuff by Al Sweigart and sentdex's YouTube videos/website pythonprogramming.net
